# UDIM Tile Combiner Script for Substance Painter and Photoshop

**UDIM Tile Combiner Script for Substance Painter and Photoshop** is a Photoshop script built for combining UDIM tile texture maps split across multiple images into one map (on a per-UDIM-number by per-material-channel basis.)

## Disclaimer

This script was written on a Windows 10 computer and tested on a Windows 10 computer. I have done my best to make the script work on MacOS with what errors I can anticipate, but I don’t have a MacOS computer to test with, so there may be issues regardless.
