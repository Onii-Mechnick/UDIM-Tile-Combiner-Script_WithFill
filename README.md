# UDIM Tile Combiner Script for Substance Painter and Photoshop

**UDIM Tile Combiner Script for Substance Painter and Photoshop** is a Photoshop script built for combining UDIM tile texture maps split across multiple images into one map (on a per-UDIM-number by per-material-channel basis.)

## Disclaimer

This script was written and tested on only a Windows computer. I have done my best to make the script work for MacOS, but there may be issues. 

The script was only tested on Photoshop CC versions 2019 and 2020, but it should work on Photoshop versions reaching back to CS6, if not further— but this is not ensured. 

## Installation Instructions

### Windows

#### If you have administrator permissions
1. Download the most recent release
2. Unzip the release file and place *UDIM Tile Combiner.jsxbin* and the *UDIM Tile Combiner Script for Photoshop Library Scripts Only* folder in the Photoshop scripts folder. *README.md* can be deleted.
3. Edit the permissions of the *UDIM Tile Combiner Script for Photoshop Library Scripts Only* folder— for Users, give the permission to write. This is to enable the active settings data and the previous session data to be written in their appropriate files.  
4. Open Photoshop and browse to File > Scripts. *UDIM Tile Combiner* should show up as a script available to run. 

#### If you don’t have administrator permissions
1. Download the most recent release
2. Locate a place on your computer where you can easily access/navigate to and where administrator permissions are not required. Unzip the release file and place *UDIM Tile Combiner.jsxbin* and the *UDIM Tile Combiner Script for Photoshop Library Scripts Only* folder at this location. *README.md* can be deleted.
4. Open Photoshop and browse to File > Scripts > Browse. Navigate to the palace where you put *UDIM Tile Combiner.jsxbin* and load the script. You will have to repeat this step each time you want to run the script.
